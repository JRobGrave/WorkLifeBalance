# WorkLifeBalance
This is a productivity app that keeps track of time, it can automatically toggle based on what window is in focus and also keep tracks of how much time you spent in other applications.You can customize what applications are considerated "work" and the app will try its best to toggle from working to resting and vice versa.
It has a window to compare current month productivity with last month productivity while also being able
to see each day activity separately combined with a force work option based on the pomodoro techinque which also gets rid of distractions.

The app requires Administrator privileges so it can detect the apps that are also ran as Administrator.
